## What are draft posts?

This is **not** an example of a draft post. Draft posts aren't included when publishing your site.

This is great for authoring work in progress content, or hiding content that shouldn't be available at the current time.

Here's some code:

    from datetime.datetime import now
    
    print(now())

The `print` keyword is a _function_ identifier in **Python 3**.

> _Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta_

Preferences

* OPS team can manage it entirely themselves.
* WebSim dev doesn’t manage or host it.

 

TODOs

1. Events page needs to integrate with WebSim API
2. Sign in should not be integrated on the marketing site.
